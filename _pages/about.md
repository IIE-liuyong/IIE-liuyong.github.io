* I received my Bachelor's in Hebei University of Technology, 2009, Tianjin, China; I received my Master's and Ph.D Degrees in Tianjin University, 2016, Tianjin, China; I am currently an associate researcher at [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/).

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in large scale machine learning, autoML, kernel method and model selection.
